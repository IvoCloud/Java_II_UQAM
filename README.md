---

This course covers advanced concepts from the Java library such as:
* _Data Structures_
* _Interfaces_
* _Lambdas_
* _Functional Interfaces_.
* _Exceptions_

### This is the last school project from JAVA II. It covers the manipulation and creation of _Linked Lists_
#### The goal is to seach in a text file in the format of `char` separated by curly brackets {}.
#### It uses an enhanced version of a _QuickSort_ algorith to find and display the position of the compared elements.

* `Liste.java` contains the search implementation and outputs the index of each element compared, until it reaches the target.
   The search algorithm also stores a refernce to the last element for the search and improves the speed of the next iterations.
* `AccoladeFermante.java`, `AccoladeOuvrante.java`, `Chainon.java` and `Mot.java` are part of the doubly linked list implementation.
